                                        Rail Rover an online platform designed for hassle-free train ticket booking. 
                                        This user-centric application empowers users to effortlessly reserve tickets, 
                                        access their booking details, and manage their profile information. In addition, 
                                        Rain Rover offers an administrative interface that equips administrators with the 
                                        tools to oversee user accounts, train schedules, and bookings efficiently. Admins have 
                                        the capability to view and modify user information, as well as take necessary actions such 
                                        as user account removal when required. Furthermore, the admin interface enables oversight of 
                                        train operations, allowing the addition, editing, or removal of train services. The same level
                                         of control extends to managing bookings, with options to add, update, or delete reservations. Agents, 
                                         another integral part of the system, can also be supervised by the admin, with options to edit or remove
                                          their profiles, ensuring comprehensive management capabilities for the entire system.

                                        The administration feature encompasses comprehensive management of train services, aligning with the core objective of enabling convenient online train ticket booking. Rain Rover continues to prioritize user-friendliness, offering a seamless booking experience with options to reserve tickets, access booking records, and update profile information. This application also extends its utility by incorporating an administrative interface, affording administrators control over user accounts, train schedules, and reservations. Administrators possess the authority to view user profiles, modify their information, and take necessary measures like account deletion when required. In addition, administrators have access to a centralized repository of train information, which includes the ability to introduce new train services, update existing schedules, and remove trains when necessary. The administration console also facilitates a comprehensive overview of bookings, enabling administrators to add new reservations, update existing ones, and delete bookings as needed. Agents, who play a vital role in the system, are equally subject to administrative scrutiny. This encompasses the ability to edit agent profiles,
                                         delete them when necessary, and manage their details to ensure the system's smooth operation.
